<p dir="ltr"><strong>ABOUT AOD</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Clan AOD is a mature gaming community established in 1999, supporting 17+ other games made into divisions. &nbsp;Currently there are over 3,000 ACTIVE members, which means you never have to play alone anymore. We are a relaxed gaming community that would rather have a good time than be on top of the leaderboards (Not to say we can’t have both from time to time).</p>

<p dir="ltr">Well-run gaming communities can be that place that offers “the tribe” and even a family that fosters this environment of gaming and positivity. We’re there for our members, and we want them to feel safe and connected while they’re with us!</p>

<p dir="ltr">The clan is also active on Twitch and streams frequently showcasing our many supported games on most days of the week. &nbsp;We have opportunities for members interested in streaming for the clan as well. Here is our official channel: https://www.twitch.tv/clanaodstream</p>

<p><strong>FOUNDED IN&nbsp;1999 AND STILL GROWING!</strong></p>

<p>The Angels of Death is a time-tested organization, supporting over 56 major gaming titles in the past 15 years including classics like Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, and Swat 3.</p>

<p>We’ve lasted this long because of the tireless efforts of people who love gaming, and our community is as diverse as the games we play. AOD is truly a family, and we’ve never stopped growing!</p>
